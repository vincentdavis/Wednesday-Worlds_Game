Approach to a Simple Multiplayer System Without a Backend Server
we create a basic multiplayer system that leverages peer-to-peer communication instead of a traditional client-server model. This approach simplifies the initial setup and reduces the need for a backend server to manage state. We'll use WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) for peer-to-peer communication, which allows browsers to connect directly to each other.

Here's a approach:

HTML and JavaScript Setup:

    Created a simple HTML page with a canvas element to display the game.
    Use JavaScript to handle user input (arrow keys) and update the game state.
    WebRTC for Peer-to-Peer Communication:

Implemented WebRTC to establish a direct connection between players.
    Use a signaling server for the initial handshake between peers. This server can be very simple and only used to exchange connection information.

Game State Management:

    Maintain the local player's state (e.g., position, direction).
    Send the local player's state to peers at real time.
    Receive the state of other players from peers and update the game display accordingly.
